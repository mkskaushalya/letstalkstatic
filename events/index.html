                <p>The IEEE Young Professionals Sri Lanka launched the LETs talk project in 2017 with the goal of
                    enhancing the knowledge and development of professional skills of young professionals to become
                    competent professionals in their future careers. This program is open to interested individuals with
                    engineering backgrounds in addition to IEEE Young Professionals. The desired goals are realized by
                    delivering sessions and workshops in collaboration with well-known individuals in the community on
                    timely, important topics and focusing on the development of skills that are necessary for the growth
                    of their careers. In addition, LETs talk unveiled most of their perceptive sessions collaborating
                    with some prominent entities. Namely IEEE Sri Lanka Section Sight, IAS Sri Lanka Chapter and
                    Luminary Learning Solutions Pvt Ltd.</p>
                <p>The participants get the chance to hear from distinguished individuals who share their insider
                    experiences in a wide range of fields. The presenters discuss opportunities, hurdles, mistakes, and
                    success stories while offering advice on the common errors a novice professional could make during
                    their first starting out. The flow is set up such that participants can consult the resource person
                    after the event to seek clarifications and advice for their questions. For the sixth year running,
                    LETs talk conducted two major programs in the year 2022 namely, a talk series “Spark Your Inner
                    self” and “UpSkill 2022”. The IEEE LETs talk Organizing Committee for 2022, which was composed of 24
                    people, organized these sessions under the supervision of IEEE Young Professionals Sri Lanka. The
                    IEEE Young Professionals Sri Lanka social media accounts, Facebook Page, Twitter, Instagram, and
                    LinkedIn accounts were used to promote these LETs talk sessions. Additionally, videos of the events
                    were published on the IEEE Young Professionals Sri Lanka YouTube channel.</p>

                    <p>Through the <b>“Spark Your Inner self”</b> talk series the LETs talk team brought out six
                        presentations in 2022. This series was primarily focused on developing personal traits and
                        crafting young industrialists into their best versions. This was a vital inspiration as well as
                        a great motivation for the passionate young professionals who seek their future pathways to be
                        more fruitful.<br><br>Due to the aftermath and present health guidelines due to the Covid-19
                        pandemic, the majority of the sessions were concluded as online sessions including the panel
                        discussion.<br><br>Each session spanned for 1 and ½ hours. The following content presents the
                        summary of the sessions we conducted throughout 2022 with a total participation of 850+,
                        including 323 IEEE members and 532 Non-IEEE members.</p>

                            attending both virtual and physical events with tremendous excitement.<br><br>The signature

                            development and its vitality.<br><br>The last segment of the UpSkill 2022 was conducted as a

                                    <p>Our second talk session of the series “Logics set up Creativity” made a pathway
                                        to let the participants understand how logic and creativity go together. It was
                                        held on 28th January via Zoom. Mr.Kushan Chanaka Amarasinghe was the speaker for
                                        the session. His competence and presentation made the whole session more live
                                        and interactive. The speaker explored the connection between logic and
                                        creativity, suggesting that these two seemingly opposing forces can actually
                                        work in tandem to produce exceptional results. <br><br>Specially, consider the
                                        relationship between logic and creativity is particularly important, as how it
                                        can have a significant impact on their future success. Look for the reason for
                                        what makes something new and distinct. Using logic to reinforce creativity is to
                                        think deeply about causes, analyze targets, and focus on creating the optimal
                                        outcome. </p>
